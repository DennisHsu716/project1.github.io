# Auto fish tank
## Summary 
Using Arduino, design an automated aquarium system that enables microcontroller-based temperature monitoring and regulation, ensuring the maintenance of the ideal water temperature in real-time. The core of the system consists of a water temperature sensor, such as the DS18B20, which continuously monitors the water temperature and transmits the data to the Arduino. When the temperature falls below a predetermined threshold, the system activates a heater to raise the water temperature. Conversely, if the temperature exceeds the desired level, the system employs a fan or other cooling devices to lower the temperature.
The entire system is designed for automatic control and can be implemented with a simple circuit. This design creates a stable aquatic environment, making it suitable for breeding tropical fish and other aquatic organisms that require consistent water temperatures. Furthermore, the integration of LED indicators for alarm functions enhances the automation and intelligence of the aquarium.
